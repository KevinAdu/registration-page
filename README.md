registration-page
=================

## Summary 

This project is a simple page which allows the user to register for an event using an HTML form.

Using NodeJS on the server side, I connect to a MongoDB to save any registered user's details.
It also displays all registered users and is able to export them to an excel spreadsheet all in a RESTful manner.


## Installation

Firstly install the MongoDB database by following this URL here:

http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/

Once you have done that, next install NodeJS onto your computer which you can do by follwing this URL:

http://nodejs.org/

Next once you have cloned this repository, navigate to the root directory of this project and enter the following command to install all the required libraries:

`npm install`

When finished, you're ready to go! Enter this in the prompt to start the application:

`node app.js`

Now navigate to this and register away!
